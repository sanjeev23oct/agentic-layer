# Enterprise Agentic Layer (DAVID-inspired)

A modular, enterprise-ready agentic orchestration system inspired by JP Morgan's LangGraph-based DAVID, featuring robust memory systems and multi-agent coordination.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
   - Supervisor/Orchestrator agent for intent interpretation and workflow management
   - Specialized sub-agents for different domains (SQL, RAG, Analytics, etc.)
   - Human-in-the-loop escalation for critical scenarios

2. **Memory Systems**
   - **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Session-specific context, reasoning chains, active workflows
   - **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: Persistent storage, user profiles, historical data, compliance logs

3. **Enterprise Security**
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Audit logging and compliance tracking
   - PII masking and data protection
   - Granular permissions and data governance

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Extensible connectors for data sources and APIs
   - Tool and knowledge integration framework
   - Scalable plugin architecture

## Key Features

- **Robust Memory Management**: Seamless bridging between short-term session context and long-term persistent knowledge
- **Enterprise Security**: Built-in compliance, audit trails, and role-based access controls
- **Personalization**: Context-aware responses based on user profiles and historical interactions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design supporting easy extension and integration
- **Continuous Improvement**: Built-in evaluation, feedback loops, and analytics

## Getting Started

[Installation and setup instructions will be added as components are implemented]

## Enterprise Compliance

This system is designed with enterprise requirements in mind:
- SOC 2 Type II compliance ready
- GDPR and data privacy compliance
- Audit trail capabilities
- Role-based access controls
- Data retention and lifecycle management
