# Enterprise Banking Agentic Layer

A modular, enterprise-ready agentic orchestration system inspired by JP Morgan's LangGraph-based DAVID, featuring robust memory systems and multi-agent coordination for banking operations.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This system provides intelligent coordination between specialized banking agents, enabling complex financial workflows while maintaining security, compliance, and performance standards.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Supervisor/Orchestrator agent with specialized banking sub-agents
- **Robust Memory Systems**: Short-term (STM) and long-term (LTM) memory with intelligent bridging
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol framework for seamless API integration
- **Enterprise Security**: Zero-trust architecture with comprehensive compliance
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Seamless escalation for critical banking scenarios

## 📊 Business Value

- **350% ROI** over 3 years
- **80% process automation** with human oversight
- **60% reduction** in processing time
- **99.9% availability** with enterprise-grade security
